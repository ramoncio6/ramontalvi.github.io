      <description>Abstract:
The initial stage of our research involves accessing the Reddit API to extract all responses -including metadata- from the post &amp;ldquo;Donald Trump has not made a single lasting positive impact on the USA during his term as president&amp;rdquo;. Subsequently, we undertake pre-processing activities such as handling missing values, stop word removal, tokenization, and lemmatization to construct the Document Term matrix. We then identify emotion analysis as a more suitable technique for forecasting document scores than sentiment and perform a descriptive analysis that relates emotion prevalence to document scores.</description>
